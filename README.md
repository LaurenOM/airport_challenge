My approach: 

Similar to boris bikes so used that as a starting point.  Worked through irb and tests in detail, checking the class can respond to methods first before writing.  Removed unnecessary tests such as capacity because the test for checking if it's full is doing this. Initially started with weather in the airport class but changed to its own class and passed as an argument to allow weather doubles to work.
